# News-Channel

This is a news portal that uses API to display news dynamically.
This site is not responsive.
It was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Each news card will show only 500 characters. The full article can be read by clicking the 'Show more' button. This will open a modal and display the full article.
News can be filtered using the category buttons. By default, it will show 'Breaking news' only. If any other category is selected, it will show the related news and the number of news found.
While loading the news using the API, it will display a circular loader.
